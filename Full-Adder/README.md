# Full-Adder

## Purpose
The main purpose of this programming assignment is to revise the topics covered in the first three weeks including fundamentals of C programming, conditional statements and repetitive statements. In this assignment, you will also practice using character datatype.

## Description
An adder is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers. Full Adder is the adder which adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C-IN. The output carry is designated as C-OUT and the normal output is
designated as S which is SUM.

## Programming Requirements
A full adder logic is designed in such a manner that can take eight inputs together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to the another. The figure below shows the block diagram of a full adder:
